In many underserved and minority skin communities, the risk of UV-related damage is high. However, finding sunscreen that truly matches their complexion is difficult as they are not the focus of much research in the field. To address this gap, SPFMatch is an accessible tool focused on helping people of color discover sunscreen products that meet their unique needs.

The application provides personalized sunscreen recommendations by considering skin tone, sensitivity, lifestyle, and user preferences. Instead of relying on trial and error or unclear marketing, users will receive guidance that helps them make informed decisions about their health. Our goal is to make the process simple, intuitive, and empowering so that users feel confident in protecting their skin.
